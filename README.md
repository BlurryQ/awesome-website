## Summary

**Hosted:** [Awesome Landing Page](https://blurryq.github.io/landing-page/)

This project is my attempt at recreating Odin's awesome landing page. Itâ€™s a fundamental exercise in mastering layouts, with a strong focus on flexbox for responsive, organized content. This layout serves as the bread and butter of web design, giving me hands-on experience in structuring a modern hero bar layout with engaging, well-spaced content.

## Features

This website showcases my new knowledge in HTML and CSS, particularly with the use of flex layout to create a clean, responsive design. The layout includes several key sections:

**Header**: A modern header with a logo and navigation links that are flex-aligned, making it easy to adapt for different screen sizes.
**Hero Section**: A prominent headline with subtext, paired with a call-to-action button and image placeholder. Flex layout is used to arrange the elements, keeping them well-balanced and visually engaging.
**Information Section**: Displays an informational header and a row of image-text pairs. Each image has a bordered, rounded style, with flexbox ensuring a consistent and responsive arrangement.
**Quote/Testimonial Section**: Includes a large, centered quote and attribution text. Flex layout supports vertical alignment, making the quote the focal point of this section.
**Call-to-Action Section**: A strong, centered call-to-action message, styled with flex for even spacing and alignment, leading to a final "Sign Up" button.
**Footer**: A simple, centered footer styled to match the header.
